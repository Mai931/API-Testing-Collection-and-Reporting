# API-Testing-Collection-and-Reporting
In this project, I focused on validating the functionality of multiple API endpoints using Postman. I created and managed a comprehensive collection of API test scripts to test key HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Each test script was designed to verify the proper handling of requests and responses for the corresponding endpoints. To streamline the testing process, I implemented environment variables for dynamic URL management, allowing the tests to be reused across different environments.

After executing the tests, I used Newman to automate the reporting process, generating detailed and structured reports that outlined the results of each test case. The reports highlighted both the successful requests and any failed responses, providing a clear overview of the API performance and helping the development team quickly identify and resolve issues. This project demonstrated my ability to manage end-to-end API testing processes efficiently, from test creation to result reporting.
